### Theme Toggle Button

The theme toggle button displays a dynamic icon that reflects the current theme:

- **Moon Icon**: Displayed for dark themes (Slate Dark, Midnight Blue, Pitch Black)
- **Color-Coded**: Each theme has a unique icon color for easy identification

## Technical Details

### Theme Implementation

ThoughtWeaver's theme system is built with modern CSS variables and React state management:

```javascript
// Themes are defined in src/utils/themes.js
export const THEMES = [
  { id: 'light', name: 'Classic Light', icon: 'sun', color: 'orange' },
  { id: 'sky', name: 'Sky Blue', icon: 'sun', color: 'blue' },
  { id: 'rose', name: 'Rose Pink', icon: 'sun', color: 'pink' },
  { id: 'dark', name: 'Slate Dark', icon: 'moon', color: 'yellow' },
  { id: 'midnight', name: 'Midnight Blue', icon: 'moon', color: 'blue' },
  { id: 'pitch', name: 'Pitch Black', icon: 'moon', color: 'orange' }
];
```

### CSS Variables

Each theme applies CSS custom properties to the document root:
- `--bg-primary`: Main background color
- `--bg-secondary`: Card and panel backgrounds
- `--text-primary`: Primary text color
- `--text-secondary`: Secondary text color
- `--border-color`: Border and divider colors
- `--accent-color`: Interactive elements and highlights

### Theme Persistence

Your theme preference is stored in the browser's localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('thoughtweaver_theme', themeId);
```

When you return to the application, your saved theme is automatically loaded and applied.

## Accessibility Considerations

All themes are designed with accessibility in mind:
- **Sufficient Contrast**: All text meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast ratios
- **Color Independence**: Information is never conveyed by color alone
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Theme toggle is fully accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Theme changes are announced to assistive technologies

## Performance

The theme system is optimized for performance:
- **CSS-Only Switching**: Theme changes use CSS classes, no re-renders required
- **Minimal Bundle Impact**: Theme definitions add <2KB to bundle size
- **Instant Apply**: Theme switching is instantaneous with no flicker
- **Efficient Storage**: Only theme ID is stored (not entire theme object)

## Customization

Want to add your own theme? The theme system is easily extensible:

1. Add your theme definition to `src/utils/themes.js`
2. Define CSS variables for your theme in `src/index.css`
3. Add the theme class selector (e.g., `.theme-yourtheme`)
4. Your theme will automatically appear in the cycle
